# Deployment Guide

Deploy World ID state bridges using the Solidity `forge` scripts that are in the `src/script/` directory. The necessary
variables need to be set in the `.env` file, you can start by copying the `.env.example` file and filling in the
necessary values. The right order is to run the `deploy` script firsts, fill-in the right values in the `.env` file from
the `broadcast` folder generated by `forge script` runs and then run the `initialize` scripts.

## Addresses of the production and staging deployments

Up to date addresses for the World ID Identity Manager and bridged World IDs can be found in the World ID
